## About

### Description and Purpose

mYOUsic is a forum where people can join and listen to music together. There are various ways that you can create a playlist of your favorite music to listen to with your friends or even strangers. You can create a temporary playlist with us to play at your hangout or party, or you can create a group so your friends or meet new people who have the same taste of music just like yours! We hope you have a nice time when you are on our forum :heart:  

### Inspiration
Both of us want to build a unique personal project that we can use on a daily basis but also highlight our skills. Moreover, I would love to learn more about Spotify API and open (for stretch features of recommending songs based on the current playlist).

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React, TypeScript

Backend: PostgreSQL, Railway, JavaScript

## Features

### Create Group

- People have three options to create a group: a temporary one or a public/private one. For either public or private ones, they need to have an account associate with our website. The temporary group doesn't need to do it.
- For each group, after creation, they can have a QR/personal link to invite people to attend the group

### Listen to music

- Each group will have ONLY ONE playlist, which people can add to the current queue.
- (For permanent group only) They also have options to vote down/up a song. A song that gets voted down by more than 50% of group participants, will not be played for the next 24 hours.
- When they add a song to the playlist, they can also get some recommendations that based on the current playlist.
