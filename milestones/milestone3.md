## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
- It is easy for me to follow the tutorial to create the job board. Also since we had included some features from the start, I can know which issues to be added

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
- I haven't been able to contact my partner. Also, it is a little bit confused about creating the Github milestone for each of the remaining milestones in this unit, so I technically just created another `.md` file for this

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

- I believe that our group has not started on the coding part instead of just setting the repo. I did set up the frontend and backend folder for this, but I am planning to finish at least the home page, log in, and sign up this page over this weekend, as it should be quick. Also I may need to revise the backend database before prompting to next step.
- I believe our team should have more communication as well as involvement in the group project.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

- I am not sure at this point, but I may have a problem of how to use the Spotify API for this project. However, without this feature, this project will be wasted. So I will prioritize to do this next week over other features

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
- I would love to know if someone can help me about the Spotify API integration
