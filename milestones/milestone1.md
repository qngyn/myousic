## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]

I think we had a pretty clear idea of what we wanted to create and how it could fit into what we have learned in this course so far. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]

Something that was challenging is making sure the project remains in scope and is something that we can accomplish. Our idea will involve outside learning and tools so we have to make sure it is something that we are capable of. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here]
I think we may need support in creating good relationships in our databases so that all the information is managed properly. We also may need help in connecting the frontend and the backend to properly implement the needed features since some of them might be complex.
